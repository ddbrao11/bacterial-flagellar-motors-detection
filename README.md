## Research Notes
This repository represents ongoing independent research exploration.

## Research Overview
This repository explores deep learning approaches for automated
identification of biological structures within 3D microscopy
reconstructions.

The research investigates how AI can assist biological
analysis workflows by reducing manual annotation effort.

## Research Motivation
Automated analysis of complex biological imaging data is critical
for scaling scientific discovery. AI-based detection methods
offer opportunities to accelerate structural biology research.

## Research Questions
- Can deep learning reliably detect microscopic structures?
- What features improve detection under noisy conditions?
- How can AI reduce manual analysis workload?

## Approach
Experiments involve preprocessing volumetric data,
training detection models, and evaluating spatial
localization accuracy.

## Limitations
Limited labeled data and imaging noise pose challenges.
Future work may include geometric deep learning approaches.
